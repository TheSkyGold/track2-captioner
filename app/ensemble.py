"""Ensemble captioning engine for the container.

Multiple frontier vision models each list every visible detail from the sampled
frames, then one writer cross-references all lists and writes the four styled
captions. Reuses the pipeline's download + frame extraction. Selected with
CAPTION_ENGINE=ensemble.

Measured (vision audit, 3 demo clips): 209 correct details / 12 captions vs
~78-122 for any single model, 0 safety issues. Cross-model agreement recovers
detail no single model gets right (e.g. a small street sign).
