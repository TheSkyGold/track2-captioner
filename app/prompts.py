System prompts + few-shot examples for the 4 mandatory styles.

Design rules baked in (from LLM Text Style Transfer literature + hackathon rubric):
    - Each style has 4 few-shots covering DIFFERENT domains (urban / animal /
      workplace / nature / sports / food) so the model doesn't overfit the 3
      example clips from the guide.
    - Every caption stays 1-2 sentences (typical hackathon judge sweet spot).
    - Each style explicitly BANS the traits of the other three, which is what
      makes the LLM-Judge give a clean style-match score.
    - Captions never invent facts the DESCRIBE stage didn't produce → protects
      the accuracy score.

# Late-bound quality boosters keep the original prompt wording intact while
# making every provider favour concrete visual evidence over generic captions.
DESCRIBE_SYSTEM += """

Additional quality requirements:
  - Treat frames as chronological evidence from one video.
  - Include visual_details: 5-9 concrete details such as colors, objects,
    posture, weather, screen content, camera view, or distinctive background.
  - Include fine_grained_observations: extract EVERY clearly visible detail.
    Work through this checklist for whatever the frames contain:
    * People: hairstyle and hair color (bun, curly, braided...), earrings,
      necklace or pendant, rings, watch, glasses, nail color, clothing layers
      with colors, and every object they touch or use (mouse, keyboard,
      phone, cup, pen).
    * Animals: species and visually obvious type ("orange tabby kitten",
      "cream-colored puppy") — pattern and coat colors, white paws or chest,
      distinctive marks; eye color ONLY when a close-up makes it unmistakable.
    * Streets/outdoor: approximate counts ("five high-rise buildings",
      "dozens of cars", "four lanes"), storefront signs and banners
      (transcribe short legible text, note the language), background terrain
      (distant hills/mountains, skyline), weather and light. Name a tree/plant
      SPECIES only if the leaf shape is clearly resolved; if you only see the
      color, say "yellow-leaved trees" — never guess "ginkgo/palm/oak".
    * Desks/indoor: every peripheral and object (mouse, coiled cable,
      monitor, plant, mug), furniture colors and materials, light fixtures.
    Prefer a specific noun over a generic one whenever the pixels support it.
  - Include salient_objects: 3-8 tangible visible objects or entities worth
    preserving in captions.
  - Include spatial_relations: 2-5 concise facts about foreground/background,
    left/right placement, near/far relations, or subject-to-object layout.
  - Include camera: a short factual description of shot type, angle, movement,
    and whether the clip appears time-lapse, handheld, static, zooming, or panning.
  - Include temporal_progression: a short phrase describing what changes.
  - Include uncertainties: [] when the frames are clear.
  - Include uncertain_details for any plausible but not fully reliable detail,
    such as exact animal breed, exact eye color, exact car count, or text on
    small signs. Do not put uncertain details in summary.
  - Hard rule: NEVER state eye color of a person or animal as a fact — frame
    lighting makes it unreliable. It belongs in uncertain_details only.
  - Hard rule on COLOR (a top source of wrong captions): attach a color word
    to an object ONLY if that is its obvious dominant color across multiple
    frames. If you are not certain, name the object with NO color word rather
    than guess. Never guess a vehicle's color ("red bus", "white truck") — say
    "a bus", "trucks" unless one color unmistakably dominates. A wrong color is
    scored as a hallucination, worse than an omitted one. A monitor/TV seen
    from behind shows only its dark housing — do NOT call the monitor "silver"
    or describe the screen content.
  - Preserve the whole scene: always record the readable BACKGROUND — building
    count/type, tree color, any storefront/sign text and its language, distant
    terrain (hills/mountains), lighting — in visual_details or salient_objects.
    These background facts must survive into the caption.
  - Only quote sign/storefront text you can actually read across frames;
    otherwise describe the sign by color and position.
  - Do NOT claim people, drivers, or occupants unless a person is actually
    visible in the frames.
  - Setting words are claims: use "garden", "forest", "park", "office",
    "kitchen" only with clear evidence. Default to what is literally visible
    ("bushes and undergrowth", "an indoor room") when unsure.
  - In cluttered indoor scenes (workshops, garages, kitchens, markets), name
    the specific tools, machines, materials, and surfaces you can actually see
    instead of summarizing the clutter generically.
  - Prefer visible specifics over generic labels like "various features".
  - If a visual detail appears in multiple frames, prefer it over a one-frame
    detail. If unsure, put it in uncertainties instead of summary.
  - Use approximate language for quantities: "several", "many", "dozens",
    "a row of", never exact counts unless clearly countable.
